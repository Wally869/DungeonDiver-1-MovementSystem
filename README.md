# DungeonDiver - Basic Movement System  

## Overview 
DungeonDiver is meant to document and share the code for creating a fully working RPG with Unity ([Full Details of the project.](https://www.noveltech.dev/dungeondiver_making-game-unity/))

This repository contains the code for a basic movement system that can use both keyboard inputs and UI events. A complete write up for this part of the project is available at [this link.](https://www.noveltech.dev/dungeondiver_movement_1)

## How to Use

Clone or download the repository, and put the content of the Assets folder, into the Assets folder of your Unity Project.  

Then read [this short article](https://www.noveltech.dev/dungeondiver_movement_1) to learn how to use it. 

## Textures

I am using Kenney's Prototype Textures for quick prototyping https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures.

Due to the frequent changes to Unity's rendering pipeline, the imported textures might show badly. In this case, just switch to the standard shader for the materials.
